		<em>Theme: THE BODY</em><br> <br>

		Concept: dealing with the sequential nature of time. Linearity vs. Continuity<br> <br>

		Materials: hemp string, red and white cardstock, glue<br><br>

		Abstract:<br><br>

		<p>My piece discusses the concept of time, and the event as an individual body within that conceptual space. I play with the idea of segments in time as bodies.

		There's a generally accepted idea that time is linear, hence the word "timeline". As such, events, as individual entities in time, are perceived to have an A to B structure. 
		However, I disagree with this simplistic linear structure. I think that there's a more complex relational nature to time and to historical events. 
		With my piece, I have two different layers of temporal relationship: first, the events themselves, and then, the events in relation to each other. 
		Each small strip, curved into a mobius strip, is an event. They are linked with one or more of the other strips. The strips being curved in on themselves in a circular (literally and figuratively) manner symbolize the way in which events drive themselves forward. 
		As they are linked up with other strips, there's a bigger picture than just the isolated event. The different colors of the strips just show that there are different types of events, or bodies.</p> <br> <br>
