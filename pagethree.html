		<em>Theme: THE WORLD</em><br><br>
		Concept: dealing with the methods of idea dissemination, and the role of repetition in creating "factual" ideas. </br> </br>
		Materials used: cigarette box $5, assorted acrylics $1/each, audiofile, drill borrowed, ipod+speakers own </br> </br>
		
		<strong>Abstract:</strong></br> </br>
		<p>For my first project, I want to do something minimalistic. I want the intention to be ambiguous, so that the viewer can interpret it differently. 
		At the same time, I want the piece to fit within the framework of my theme. In other words, I want the project to be meaningful in many different ways, yet still have a direction and a focus. 
		So, I decided to concentrate on one concept: the role that repetition plays in idea dissemination. 
		My main thought is this: familiarity with an object occurs when we encounter it repeatedly. 
		Familiarity and stability are strange concepts, illusions that we maintain for our own comfort. 
		We tend to believe things that are given to us repeatedly and through familiar mediums, and we forget to question their validity.
		The information that we get about the world usually comes through the same institutions: news stations, newspapers, websites, etc.
		My project will call into question that blind belief.I plan to utilize the medium of painting. I'm going to repeat a minimal motif on a bare canvas,
		to show how the medium through which something is presented is almost as important as the information itself. Each motif will be in a different color,
		each color representing a different idea. Because the different ideas are presented the same way (i.e., the motif), I argue, the ideas become easier for us to accept.
		The box will be painted like a TV, with speaker placed inside playing the (below) audio recording.</p><br /> <br /> <br />
